? Java grammar does not allow void foo(@SuppressWarnings ...)
? Java grammar has problem with 'public 'enum types (gmf) or using 'enum as variable names (jhotdraw)
? Java5 grammar does not allow Collections.<...>() access (gmf)
? Count the diff of any two structures 
v Compute the preferred literal constants
v Create the verilog grammar and normalisations
v Remove the clones in the kept structures 
v Process the `ignored by rule' to perform the transformations selectively
v Process the `redefine' rules such that adding annotations does not require substantial change of the original grammars
v Generate binary (bytecode) of the TXL transformations based on the platform of choice (Darwin, Linux, etc.)
v Generalise the rules in Makefile such that it is easy to extend it to more grammars
v Process the `ordered by rule' to perform user-defined reorderings
