? Compute/measure the diff of any two structures 
? Process the `redefine' rules such that adding annotations does not require substantial change of the original grammars
? Process the `ignored by rule' to perform the transformations selectively
v Process the `ordered by rule' to perform user-defined reorderings
v Generalise the rules in Makefile such that it is easy to extend it to more grammars
v Generate binary (bytecode) of the TXL transformations based on the platform
  of choice (Darwin, Linux, etc.)
