@1. Don't cache templates if dynamic templates option is on;
2. [199747] Support shortcuts in the Lite diagrams (including notation model update for links between alien shortcuts);
3. Decorations should be visible;
4. TransactionalUpdateManager: more notifications to be dispatched to parents, make it possible to add more in subclasses;
5. On element creation, it should be given an opportunity to contribute its notational update commands;
6. [199749]: Delete from View supported (request, edit policy, command, UI action);
7. Add @@generated tags where they were missing;
8. ChildNotationModelRefresher: if the child feature is derived transient, notation model refresher should listen to containment feature.
