log
@Emitter became top-level entity (TextEmitter), oddness of JetAdapter and Emitter api were cleared.
GeneratorBase lost knowledge about JET.
Parts of gmf.common made internal to avoid possible API issues.
ImportAssistant refactored to know name of compilation unit to avoid problems like #134506.
FigureGenerator's reuse of ImportAssistant removed.
[mgolubev] Tests for #134506 and 142553
