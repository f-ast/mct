log
@overriding recent changes introduced (along with fixing #133836) in GMFMap model, as it's merely a 'shortcut', quite frequent though. Still, adding few new concepts just for the sake of single usecase (I do admit it's popular) seems excessive to me.
GMFMap kept the same as old (no new notions introduced), GMFGraph got generalization from DiagramLabel to DiagramNode to make it possible to use DiagramLabels for NodeMappings (thus, it's possible to detect such nodes in the DGMT)
Tests added to make sure we generate correct genModel for both cases.
