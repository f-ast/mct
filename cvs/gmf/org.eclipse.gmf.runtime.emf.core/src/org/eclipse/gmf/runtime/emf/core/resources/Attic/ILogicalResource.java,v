/**
 * <p>

 * physical resources.  In every way, the resource looks and behaves like a
 * monolithic resource; it is only in the persistence to multiple resources
 * that it differs.
 * </p><p>
 * The roots of the overall "logical" resource are under the control of the
 * client:  they may be added or removed at will, and even stored in separate
 * physical resources like any other element.  Elements in the content forest
 * may be {@@link #separate(EObject, URI) separated} into a different physical
 * resource from its container.  Multiple elements in different locations in
 * the tree structure may be separated into different or even the same physical
 * resources.  Each separate element is a root in the resource that stores it.
 * </p><p>
 * Implementations of this interface cannot be instantiated directly.  Rather,
 * the MSL's
 * {@@linkplain org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.resources.MResourceFactory resource factory}
 * implementation creates <code>ILogicalResources</code> for any file extensions
 * or URI schemes on which it is registered.  To obtain the logical resource
 * view of any resource in an MSL editing domain, use the
 * {@@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.edit.MEditingDomain#asLogicalResource(Resource)}
