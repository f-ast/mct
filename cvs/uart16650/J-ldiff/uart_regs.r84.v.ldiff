> // Bug Fixes:
> //  * Possible loss of sync and bad reception of stop bit on slow baud rates fixed.
> //   Problem reported by Kenny.Tung.
> //  * Bad (or lack of ) loopback handling fixed. Reported by Cherry Withers.
> //
> // Improvements:
> //  * Made FIFO's as general inferrable memory where possible.
> //  So on FPGA they should be inferred as RAM (Distributed RAM on Xilinx).
> //  This saves about 1/3 of the Slice count and reduces P&R and synthesis times.
> //
> //  * Added optional baudrate output (baud_o).
> //  This is identical to BAUDOUT* signal on 16550 chip.
> //  It outputs 16xbit_clock_rate - the divided clock.
> //  It's disabled by default. Define UART_HAS_BAUDRATE_OUTPUT to use.
