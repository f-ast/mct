1.2.4.1
log
@1. Added getDesktop to the DrawingEditor.  added null returns to all Classes that dont fully support
   the Desktop architecture yet, like the applets.

2. Added a figureSelection listener to the DrawingEditor so one can register with the DrawingEditor to
   hear figure selection events.  You can still register with the individual DrawingViews if you wish.
   The DrawingEditor will guarantee that it only fires this event on the active view, so it saves a listener
   from having to register and unregister with views to hear this event each time the activeView changes.
   All Commands were doing this register/unregister dance.

3. AbstractCommand now registers for figureSelectionEvents with the drawingEditor as opposed to the
   DrawingView.

4. Went back to viewCreated and viewDestroying naming.  flip flopping.  Its actually more accurate.  the
   real issue is that 2 events are missing, viewDestroyed and viewCreating.  dont need them yet, but
   they may materialize in the future.

5. Went back to Tool CompositeTool being enabled even when no figure is selected.

6. FigureSelectionListener now extends java.util.EventListener now because I am too lazy to write
   an event handler just yet.

7. implemented new findFigureInside() fix.  needs testing.

8. standardDrawingView selectionZordered now returns figures in the proper order(not reversed).

 * This event is fired by the {@@link DrawingView DrawingView}.
 * Yes I know, I'm in violation for extending java.util.EventListener.  I'm 
 * too lazy to write my own event dispatcher right now so I'm using swings...
