@Remove EventListenerList in favor of simple List where possible.
EventListenerList duplicates the whole list for each additional add and is
quite heavy for instances where its not required since these lists are not
modified from events they fire.

@Clean up head to be what it was before i mistakenly committed my changes to it.
My changes should have been committed to a branch, and let mrfloppy merge to the trunk.

1.4.4.2
log
@1. javadoc comments and corrections and clarifications
2. Drawing no longer exposes its drawing change listener, but has a method for those who want the drawing to request all views of it to be updated.
3. all removeAll() methods in CompositeFigure now have single consistent implementation.
4. standardDrawing unlock calls notify instead of notifyAll since only 1 can grab the lock anyway.

	 *  investigate seperating this event out because the other 2 occur often
	 *  and you end up listening to events frequently, that you are not 
	 *  interested in.
	 *  Likely titles should be simple properties and stored in the attributes.
	 *  Then we add an attribute listener, and voila.
