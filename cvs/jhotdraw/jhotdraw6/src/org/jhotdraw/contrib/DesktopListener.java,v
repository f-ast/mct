@Refactoring of Cursor:
- java.awt.Cursor (class) has been sistematically replaced with CH.ifa.draw.contrib.framework.Cursor (interface)
- a new default implementation of Cursor (interface) has been added: CH.ifa.draw.contrib.standard.AWTCursor

@Remove EventListenerList in favor of simple List where possible.
EventListenerList duplicates the whole list for each additional add and is
quite heavy for instances where its not required since these lists are not
modified from events they fire.

@Clean up head to be what it was before i mistakenly committed my changes to it.
My changes should have been committed to a branch, and let mrfloppy merge to the trunk.
This will happen from now on.
