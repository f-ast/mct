@Various comments.
Fixed undo bug which always restored dependent figures, even if they were deleted in a
seperate operation.

@Restored the ContainerFigure.  Its very problematic for tools, but I have a better understanding of the undo system now.
As a result I have restored most of what was their again with explanations on how it works for the next traveler...
Also fixed a few issues with grouping and ungrouping. since figures can no longer be in 2 containers at once the container
hopping that was being done by the group command would fail.  I believe border tool did similar hopping by having a figure
as part of the drawing and part of the borderFigure temporarily.  Cant do that anymore.

 * 1.  Visit all figures reachable from the hostFigure.  Contained figures and
 *     dependent figures.  Search the complete tree of figures reachable through
 *     either the dependent figures, or the contained figures.
 * 2.  Delete all figures directly contained in the Drawing. (e.g.<code>containsFigure()</code>)
 * 3.  Return a list of all deleted figures.
 *
 * You must visit figures that are dependent upon figures dependent upon the hostFigure.
 * Full tree search of dependent figures is necessary.
 *
 * dependent figures does not dictate drawing order, but currently the order of
 * readd to the drawing is dependent upon when a figure gets visited.  And this
 * has the effect of dictating drawing order.  Z needs work.
 *
 *
 * Note: do not delete figures contained in other figures, only those directly
 * contained in the drawing.
