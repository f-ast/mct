<H1>About JHotDraw</H1>
<HR>
The JHotDraw architecture was inspired by two sources:
<UL>
<LI>
<a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/brant/HotDraw/HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a><br>
HotDraw is a drawing framework for Smalltalk. It was originally developed
by Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham.
<LI>
<a href="ftp://ftp.ifa.ch/pub/ET++/">ET++</a><br>
ET++ is a comprehensive and portable application framework and
class library for C++. ET++ was developed by Andre Weinand and Erich Gamma.
</UL>
<p>
JHotDraw was developed by Thomas Eggenschwiler and Erich Gamma.
It was originally planned to be a trivial case study for an applied
design patterns seminar. But then it was too much fun to just stop there...
<p>
<H2>Acknowledgements</H2>
We have received valuable input from Uwe Steinmueller, Doug Lea, Kent Beck, and Ward Cunningham.
