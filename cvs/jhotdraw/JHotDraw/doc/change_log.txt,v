JHotDraw 5.2 changes (29.6.2001 by MrFloppy)
- SelectionFigure is now an interface. The default implementation CH.ifa.draw.standard.StandardSelectionFigure
- A FigureSelectionListener interface has been introduced in CH.ifa.draw.framework. An DrawingEditor
  is now a FigureSelectionListener and the signature for all selectionChanged() methods has been
  changed to figureSelectionChanged().
- CH.ifa.draw.util.Command is now an interface. A AbstractCommand can be found in CH.ifa.draw.standard.
- All commands used to have a fView field. This has been moved to CH.ifa.draw.standard.AbstactCommand
- A CH.ifa.draw.standard.StandardDrawingView has now a paintComponents() method instead of a paint()
  and update() method. This allows the CH.ifa.draw.util.FloatingTextField to be a javax.swing.JTextField
  instead of a java.awt.TextField.
- CH.ifa.draw.figures.AbstractLineDecorator has been missing
- DrawApplet, DrawApplication and derived classes are now programmed towards the DrawingView interface
  instead of using StandardDrawingView. That leads to occasional cast when some additional StandardDrawingView
  functionality is required in some specialized cases. Applications that were derived from DrawApplication
  and used to override the createContents() methods should now return a DrawingView as well@
