Description:
        Prototype implementation of a set of general theoretical
        transformations from limited imperative to pure functional form.

        This specfication extends the grammar of the pure functional
        subset of the T'Nial programming language to include limited forms 
        of several imperative programming features, including sequential 
        statements, variables and assignment, procedures, out and inout 
        parameters, and global variables (through existential parameters).

        The ruleset prototypes the general transformations of these features
        to pure functional form described in the paper "The Safe Introduction 
        of Imperative Features into a Functional Programming Language"
        by T.C.N Graham.
